#[doc = r#"
One-byte messages that only occur in live MIDI events.

Real-Time messages are used for synchronization and are intended for all clock-
based units in a system. They contain Status bytes only — no Data bytes. Real-
Time messages may be sent at any time — even between bytes of a message which has
a different status. In such cases the Real-Time message is either acted upon or
ignored, after which the receiving process resumes under the previous status.

They are usually time-sensitive, get top priority and can even be transmitted in between other
messages.
