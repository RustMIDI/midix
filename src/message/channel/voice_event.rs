/// Represents a MIDI message, usually associated to a MIDI channel.

/// There are seven different types of voice events.
/// - note on: Play a particular note
/// - note off: Stop playing a particular note
/// - [control change](Controller): Things like panning, modulation, expression, holding a pedal and the alike.
/// - [program change](Program): a way to change the underlying "voice" of a channel's instrument.
/// - after touch: After a note's been played, modify the [`Velocity`] without having
///   to send another note on command
/// - channel pressure after touch: change the velocity for all currently playing notes. this one's pretty unusual to find.
/// - [pitch bend](PitchBend): "curve" the frequency of a note.
///
/// If you wish to parse a MIDI message from a slice of raw MIDI bytes, use the
/// [`LiveEvent::parse`](live/enum.LiveEvent.html#method.parse) method instead and ignore all
/// variants except for [`LiveEvent::Midi`](live/enum.LiveEvent.html#variant.Midi).
